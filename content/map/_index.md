This map shows our node locations. If there is a supernode or hub node withing range of your building, you may be able to join our network. The potential nodes are from our [join form](/join). We are working to turn these into active nodes by expanding our coverage and increasing our rate of installs.

The blue lines are over-the-air connections. The gray lines are speculative connections. The LinkNYC public access points can also be used as gateways. 

We are very interested in finding people from other parts of the city that are willing to build and maintain networks for their neighborhood! We will give you lots of help in this. If you would like to volunteer for your neighborhood please [email us](mailto:contact@nycmesh.net).
