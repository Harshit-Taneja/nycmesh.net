*NYC Mesh is a non-profit community network and depends on the generous support of those using the network and volunteers. Internet speeds may vary due to a variety of factors including home network configuration, router, the time of day, and the location within New York City. For further information, please visit our [FAQ page](https://www.nycmesh.net/faq) or email questions to info@nycmesh.net.
 
**Individuals may also elect to join the NYC Mesh network by ordering and installing the equipment themselves in which case there are no “One-Time-Charges.” NYC Mesh volunteers are happy to answer questions about how to order and install the equipment. For further information, please visit the NYC Mesh [docs](https://docs.nycmesh.net/) page or reach out on [Slack](https://nycmesh.slack.com).
 
**NYC Mesh is a community network committed to connecting all New Yorkers. We believe that cost shouldn’t prohibit anyone from accessing the internet.**
