Metrics based upon network monitoring and member reported speeds. Speeds are not guaranteed due to vicissitudes of wireless connections.

NYC Mesh members can check the performance of their current Internet connection using speedtest.net, which tests the speed that they are receiving on NYC Mesh's network to the end user device. These tests are dependent on a variety of factors, including the customer's home network configuration, router, and Internet connected devices, and the time of day, and therefore do not reflect the performance of the NYC Mesh network only.
