The internet is not a product you buy, it is a network you join. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) aren't really selling you bandwidth, they are renting you cables. If you own your own cables or wireless connection you don't need to pay an ISP.

With an NYC Mesh antenna on your building, you have joined the internet and bypassed renting cables.

The most difficult thing about connecting a building to the internet is the internal wiring. If a building has its own wiring to the apartments, it is quick and easy for us to connect.
