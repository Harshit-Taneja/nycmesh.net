The most common unifier in the tech industry is the emphasis on learning, and the technology community at large has a lot of well-intentioned folks willing to dedicate their time and skills to making technology reflect the world we want to live in. NYC Mesh is made up entirely of volunteers, many of whom work in tech or adjacent fields and choose to spend their time and skills making the internet more accessible. One of our members, Aakash Patel, [started a DOT surveillance camera archive project to support protestors](ww.nycmesh.net/blog/nyc-surveillance-archive/) in the beginning of this year’s BLM movement because he felt it would align with NYC Mesh’s values of transparency, accessibility, and community. In his own words:

*Holding the police accountable requires witnessing, recording and sharing footage of their actions. Inspired by Darnella Frazier, whose recording of George Floyd’s murder sparked a global movement, I am archiving NYC traffic camera footage with help from the NYC Mesh community to make it easier for the public to identify police misconduct.*
