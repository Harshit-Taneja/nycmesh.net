The internet is not a product you buy, it is a network you join. 

The internet is a network of networks. It was started by networks joining together. There was no charge as both side benefitted from this. When networks join it is called "[peering](../../peering)" and this continues today. Nobody pays for this peering.

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are able to get between you and this free peering community by running cables to your apartment and charging rent for these cables. ISPs aren't really selling you bandwidth, they are renting you cables. If you own your own cables or wireless connection you can bypass the ISP. Community networks bypass the ISPs and their fees by using long range wireless connections from data centers to your roof.

The internet is distributed across the planet with no central ownership. If you connect to the internet you are extending the internet to your device which is now part of the internet, and you can extend that connection to others.

We can stop renting cables from ISPs and use community networks to extend the internet to everyone.
