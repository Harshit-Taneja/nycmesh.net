The internet is not a product you buy, it is a network you join. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) aren't really selling you bandwidth, they are renting you cables. If you own your own cables or wireless connection you don't need to rent from an ISP. The real cost of bandwidth to your phone or apartment is around $1 a month for a large network.

The internet is a network of networks. It started by networks joining together. Nobody charged as both side benefitted from this. Today this still occurs and when networks join it is called "peering". NYC Mesh peers with WoodyNet, Apple, Google, Akamai and many others. Nobody pays for this peering, but there are fees to be inside a data center to enable the peering which average to about $1 per month per person connected.

ISPs are able to get between you and this free peering connection by running cables to your apartment and charge rent for their cables. Community network can bypass the ISPs and their fees with wireless connections and also running cables.

The internet is distributed across the planet with no central ownership. If you connect to the internet you are extending the internet to your device which is now part of the internet, and you should extend that connection to others.

NYC Mesh allows 

NYC Mesh has donated data connections inside two data centers. 

With an NYC Mesh antenna on your building, you have joined the internet and bypassed renting cables.

The most difficult thing about connecting a building to the internet is the internal wiring. If a building has its own wiring to the apartments, it is quick and easy for us to connect.
