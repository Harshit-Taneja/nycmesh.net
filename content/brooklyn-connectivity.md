title: "Brooklyn Connectivity Update 2018-10-25"
---

A failed update has caused downtime at the major hub node in Brooklyn. We are working on this and will update this message when it is working again.
Please sign into the [#1340-alerts](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/CBK1FR63A/) channel on slack to receive updates.

As always, if you are experiencing issues with your connection, you can:
  - Create a [support ticket](/support) or 
  - Contact us on [the #support channel on slack](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/C679UKBUK). 

_Context: Our Supernode 2 had to be taken down for roof repair which forced us to make major changes to the area's network. 
The good news is many new hub nodes are coming online, so there will be more choices to connect to in the coming weeks._
