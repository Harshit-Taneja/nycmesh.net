title: "Brooklyn Connectivity Update 2018-10-25"
---

A failed upgrade has caused downtime at the major hub node in Brooklyn. We are working on this and will update this message when it is working again. We hope to be replacing the faulty router this afternoon. Estimated to be back up around 5pm

You can also get updates in the [#1340-alerts](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/CBK1FR63A/) channel on Slack.

As always, if you are experiencing issues with your connection, you can:
  - Create a [support ticket](/support) or 
  - Contact us on [the #support channel on slack](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/C679UKBUK). 

_Context: Recently our Supernode 2 had to be taken down for roof repair which forced us to make major changes to the area's network. We are still working on improving the new connections. The good news is many new hub nodes are coming online, so there will be more choices to connect to in the coming weeks._
