A storm took down our node 1417 and is affecting 3 nodes in the East Williamsburg area. We hope to have this fixed tomorrow.

Problem fixed! All ok.

A failed upgrade caused downtime at the major hub node in Brooklyn this morning. It was fixed at 4:15pm today.

_Recently our Supernode 2 had to be taken down for roof repair which forced us to make major changes to the area's network. We are still working on improving the new connections. The good news is many new hub nodes are coming online, so there will be more choices to connect to in the coming weeks._
